# Jam Bot

nicer view of what u will need if u wanna set up jambot [here](https://jamieplayz29.github.io/currentjambot)

Or add Jam Bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=709026936919293984&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). This intance was running 24/7 although due to issues with heroku the instance runs on my local machine so jambot will only be online when my PC is on.
